- When encountering inevitable concepts, must have a centralized place to introduce this concept, and link to it from other places. For example: Event Loop.
- When writing documents, shift your thinking, and examine whether others can understand it from a layman's perspective.
- When there are feature changes in the future, must modify all relevant parts, and not just one.
- Each functional module must have a complete example.
