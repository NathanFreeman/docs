**Documentation Guidelines**

- Use straightforward language and try to introduce as few technical details of Swoole underlying technology as possible.
- Some underlying concepts can be maintained in a dedicated 'hack' section later.
- When encountering inevitable concepts, there must be a centralized place to introduce this concept, and link to it from other places (e.g., Event Loop).
- When writing documents, shift your thinking and examine whether others can understand it from a layman's perspective.
- When there are feature changes in the future, all relevant parts must be modified, not just one.
- Each functional module must have a complete example.
